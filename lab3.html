            sensing, and sound detection. Additionally, the lab focused on
            connecting the Artemis to bluetooth and passing information from a

            To connect the Arduino to bluetooth, we first had to install an

            a jupiterlab virtual environment. The goal of this section was to
            communicate to teh Artemis through bluetooth and have the artemis
            communicate back as well.

            The first step to connect the Artemis to Bluetooth was to add the
            artemis address to the python .yaml file. The next step was to
            generate a UUID or Universally Unique Identifier. The UUID is useful
            in establishing a unique identifier for different types of
            communication or different types of data.

            To communicate between the computer and the Artemis, a series of

            first command was the ECHO command which sends a string to the
            Artemis and has the Artemis send the string back.

          <p>
            To handle more incomming data from the Artemis, a notification
            handler was built. Connecting this notification to a modified
            version of GET_TIME_MILLIS allows the Artemis to send a stream of
            millisecond data to the computer. However, because the computor
            cannot read the data fast enough, not all of it is captured. To
            account for this, the millis data is gathered first and then sent to
            the Artemis.

            Similarly to how millis data was gathered, temperature data is also
            gathered. This data is appended onto the millis data to capture the
            temperature at a given moment of operation. The python script parses
            the incoming string and extracts the time and temperature data into
            two seperate arrays.

        <h2 class="section-header">Contrasting the Two Methods of Data Acquisition</h2>
        <div class="text-section">
          <p>
            Directly sending data and to the computer every cycle and gathering it first before sending it proved to have different benefits. 
            While immediately sending data allows the computer to get it in real time, the data has a large time interval. 
            This makes it difficult to do calculations that require precise data or handle rapidly changing data sets. 
            Meanwhile, gathering data first and then sending it allows the Artemis to gather small interval measurements. 
            However, the data cannot be sent as soon as it is read, meaning completely live calculations cannot be computed. 
            The best soution is likely a combination of the two methods of data acquisition. Gathering small amounts of data and sending them allows relatively real-time calculations with little lag.
