            The goal of this lab was to implement a balancing algorithm similar
            to an inverted pendulum to keep the RC car balanced on two wheels.
            While there are multiple methods to implement a balancing algorithm,
            including developing state-space methods such as using an LQR
            controller, I chose to take a simpler approach using a modified PID
            controller based on a physics model that I developed. Over time, the
            method for controlling the system was adapted to improve
            performance. However, hardware limitations prevented a highly robust
            controller from being developed.

            As an initial approach, I drew a simple free-body diagram to examine
            the forces acting on the car as it balances on two wheels,
            particularly focusing on anything that causes torque around the
            center of mass of the car. The forces identified were the force of
            gravity, normal force, and force exerted by the controller. Rather
            than focusing on restorative control, I initially focused on simply
            keeping the torque equal to 0. To do this, I tried to find a
            coefficient that would keep the car at roughly whatever initial
            angle it was started at. After that, I started adding an additional
            PID controller to create a restorative force.

            Since the force that the wheels need to exert scales with the
            tangent of angle, the input force becomes, quite reasonably,
            infinite as the car falls flat. The inputted PWM also isn’t
            proportional to force but velocity, so the PWM would have to
            increase exponentially to keep the car at a non-zero angle. This
            introduced a problem where the torque on the wheels was limited by
            what the motors would provide. Luckily, the goal is to balance
            around a vertical position, so as long as the car remains within a
            range of the goal angle, the maximum PWM should never be reached.

            To implement the controller, I used a similar method to orientation
            control in lab 6. However, to optimize for computation, I isolated
            the code such that it would not listen for bluetooth signals. The
            key to being able to complete the inverted pendulum problem was
            using DMP, which provided much more accurate pitch data than using
            just the accelerometers. This allowed me to balance around a
            relatively consistent angle. However, even with DMP, the angle would
            shift slightly, so I implemented a command that would allow me to
            make slight correct to the angle that the robot is balancing around.

            For the PID control, I initially decided to write a controller
            proportional directly to the pitch of the car, instead of the
            tangent. Since, at small angles, the response should be linear, this
            should work. However, later, I switched to having the controller
            proportional to the tangent of the pitch, since the linear
            controller would not work well when there were large oscillations.
            After finding a Kp term that just barely avoided oscillations, I
            tried running the system but found that the car would fall over too
            easily. Therefore, I eventually added a derivative controller
            designed to prevent the car from falling in any direction. I tuned
            the Kd term to just barely reach the vertical position after
            recovering from a 20-degree lean. My final Kp and Kd values were 600
            and 0.3 respectively.

            In the simulator, the algorithm is run. The robot moves around the
            map, and the predicted location of the robot is updates as it moves.
            The red in the simulator corresponds to the information generated by
            the odometry model. Meanwhile, the gread corresponds to the ground
            truth and the blue line corresponds to the robot’s belief. Since the
            robot’s ground truth and belief remain consistent after multiple
            iterations of running the simulator, the Bayes filter seems to be
            accurate in its localization.
