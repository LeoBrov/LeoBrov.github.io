        <div class="text-section">
          <p>
            The objective of this lab was to control the RC car with the Artemis
            microcontroller. To do so, it was necessary to replace the internal
            components of the RC car with new components driven by the Artemis,
            specifically two motor drivers and all the electronics explored in
            the previous labs.

        <div class="text-section">
          <p>
            The first important consideration of this lab was which pins to
            connect the motor drivers to. Pins 8 and 10 on the Artemis cannot be
            used for PWM, so the chosen pins were 4, 5, 6, and 7. These were
            conveniently placed near each other and allowed for easy placement
            of the motor drivers inside the RC car. The next consideration was
            how to power the motors. The motors need to have their own battery
            because they draw a lot of power and may interfere with the Artemis
            if they are all connected to one power supply. As such both motors
            were connected to a designated 850mAh battery with a rated voltage
            of 3.7V, which is suitable for the motors. This battery was powerful
            enough to power both motors. Finally, it was important to consider
            wire lengths when soldering the circuit due to the placement
            requirements of certain components, such as the time of flight
            sensors, within the car.

          <p>
            To make sure that the motor drivers were working as intended, it was
            necessary to test them before soldering them to the motors. The
            initial test was simply making sure that all the pins were properly
            connected. Using a multimeter, the continuity of all the wires was
            checked and the circuit was confirmed to be wired correctly. The
            next step was to test if the proper PWM signal was produced by the
            motor drivers. To test this, both motor drivers were connected to
            the Artemis, and a power supply with 3.7V. It was important for the
            power supply to mirror the voltage of the battery such that the test
            accurately matched the real circuit and so that none of the
            components would blow up. Using analogWrite() on the two pins of the
            motor drivers, a PWM signal was produced that was measured by the
            oscilloscope. Since only one set of BNC test leads for the
            oscilloscope was available at the time of measurement, the two motor
            drivers were tested individually.

            After confirming that the circuit worked correctly, the internal
            components of the RC car were removed. The motor drivers were then
            soldered to the motors following the circuit mentioned in the
            prelab. Finally, the motors were tested by running code that would
            spin each set of wheels forward and then backward. After confirming
            that the test worked when powered by the computers, it was repeated
            with an independent battery powering the RC car.

        <div class="text-section">
          <p>
            Due to inertial restrictions and frictional forces, PWM signals
            under a certain threshold do not cause the car to move forward. It
            was therefore necessary to determine what PWM frequency was
            sufficient to move the car. To accomplish this, the car was set to
            discretely increase the PWM signal until it started moving. By
            observing when the motion occurred, it was possible to identify the
            minimum PWM signal required to move the car. During tests, the car
            would sometimes start at duty cycles as low 32/256. However, the
            duty cycles of 48/256 proved to be the most reliable in consistently
            making the car move forward, so it was designated as the minimum
            threshold.

        <div class="text-section">
          <p>
            Although both motors are theoretically identical, in the real world
            they have some differences. As such both motors may not spin at the
            exact same speed when powered by the same PWM signal. However, using
            a calibration factor on one motor would allow for the two motors to
            move in sync. In my case, even with no calibration factor, the
            motors moved at almost the same rates. However, increasing the PWM
            of the left motor by 1.02 proved to slightly minimize the
            differences between the two motors. To test the differences in the
            motors, the car was programmed to move in a straight line.

            With the circuit complete and the motors calibration, it was time to
            test some moves. Keeping it simple, I had the car move forward and
            backward and then perform an S maneuver. The control for this was
            entirely open-loop, so there was no internal feedback. However, the
            car still performed relatively well.
